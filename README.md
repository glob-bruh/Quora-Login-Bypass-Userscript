# Quora Login Bypass Userscript

## Purpose:

This userscript bypasses the prompt to login or signup to Quora by automatically adding `?share=1` to the URL. 

## Setup: 

1) Find a userscript manager, such as Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey. 
2) Visit the raw version of the JavaScript file in this repo.
3) An extension page should open allowing you to install the script.
